Getting started with bots was relatively easy

Issue 1:
Ran into many errors as C:\Users\ASC\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python35-32\Lib\site-packages\zulip-0.2.5-py3.5.egg\zulip\__init__.py 
was no compatible with python 3, imported and ran modules from python 2

Had to make changes to raw python file (__init__.py) --> Attached final __init__.py fyi

Issue 2:
After posting a message in another stream besides followup using @followup/@follow-up to start,
found it unable to click and redirect to followup stream without going back to the home page
and manually redirecting to followup stream
